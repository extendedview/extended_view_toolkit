========================================
                 TODO
========================================
things that should be done in the future


Fundamental changes:
--------------------
*   divide all modules in [ev_xxxx_gui] and [ev_xxxx_dsp]
    *   modules without gui: for performance reasons
    *   only gui: for remote from other computers
    *   no changed behavior for the standard modules [ev_xxxx]

Communication:
--------------
*   solution for easy midi integration (with midi-learn)
    *   just map midi-controls to existing osc-messages?
        (midi<--->osc converter?)
*   map osc-values to other osc-values? osc-learn function?
*   dmx control
    *   control lighting via dmx
    *   receive control data from lighting console
*   ability to record/play automations


New modules:
------------
*   [ev_glslbuf] module, consisting of a [ev_glsl] rendered in a framebuffer
    (for quicker patching of shader-based effects)
*   [ev_glslbuf2] object, containing two [ev_glslbuf] for 2-pass shaders (i.e. blur)
*   [ev_paint] module to paint maskings for video mappings with mouse/tablet
*   [ev_audio] module to play sound for videos in sync with [ev_vid]
*   [ev_presenter] module to load presentation slides and provide basic 
    functions for presentations
*   [ev_pano_virtual] virtual panoramic camera to create panoramic live-imagery 
    from inside a rendered 3d-scene.
*   [ev_playlist] playlist module for media files (sound, video)
    *   save playlist in textfile
*   [ev_audio] audioplayer for synchronised audio to [ev_vid]
*   [ev_pro_55easy]
*   [ev_3d] 3d-based projection mapping modules
    *   load 3d models of the room out of blender, etc. into Pd
*   kinect-based modules (using [pix_freenect]/[pix_openni])
    *   depth-image to 3d-model converter
    *   stitching of depth-images
        *   panoramic kinect camera system
        *   cover big stages with multiple kinect
    *   treshold module, to set tresholds of depth-image
*   file-pool module that watches specified folder and adds containing
    media files automatically. with ability to send files to playlists.
*   solution for camera that captures a full dome, and to project such spherical
    imagery onto a dome-shaped screen.
*   [ev_pro_3] triangular projection module
*   [ev_subtitles] subtitle text module

Changes in existing modules:
----------------------------
*   match vertex behavior of [ev_pro_55] and [ev_pro_22/33]
    *   decide for one algorithm in all projection modules?
    *   toggle to select algorithm the modules?
*   improve mouse/keyboard interaction with [ev_pro_xx] inside the gemwin
    *   select multiple points to be able to move them together
    *   move selected points with keyboard arrow keys
    *   add mouseover functionality for modules inside modules
        (backwards calculation of vertex transformation)
*   [ev_vid]: changeable playback speed
*   [ev_gemwin] change cursor type (+ ability to hide cursor)

New examples:
-------------
*   simple VJ setup: dual videoplayer, video-mixer, video-effect, ev_pro_22easy.
*   midi control
*   osc remote from other computer / other pd instance
