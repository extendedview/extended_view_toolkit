Collected abstractions for absolute data collapse.


Description
-----------

KOLLABS is an abstraction library for Pure Data, that covers data management, OSC- and MIDI-communication and state saving.

This library is still work in progress.
    
For questions or bug reports, contact me:
mail@marianweger.com


Getting started
---------------

open [ds_help] for state-saving.
open [midi_help] for MIDI communication,
open [osc_help] for OSC communication


Requirements
------------

Kollabs is built completely in Pd-Vanilla and thereby does not require any external libraries (except mrpeach/iemnet for OSC communication).
It works with any Pd version above 0.42, but >= 0.43 is highly recommended.
