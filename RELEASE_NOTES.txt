=====================
EXTENDED VIEW TOOLKIT
=====================


Release Notes v0.4 Rotterdam
============================

This version of Extended View Toolkit is not compatible to previous 
versions!!!

*  completely reworked storage-solution with:
      * scene based playlist
      * individual parameter transitions between scenes
   (based on kollabs abstraction-library)
*  added a bunch of new examples
*  reworked the old examples

input abstractions
------------------
*  simplified organisation of input-modules: 
   features for panoramic imagery are in own modules now
*  reworked [ev_vid] with many new features
*  new [ev_base] module to allow fast creation of own modules, 
   that are directly integrated in EVT«s storage and control system

panoramic abstractions
----------------------
*  new [ev_360] module for panoramic video with one camera
*  new [ev_pano_stitch] module for stitching of multiple images
*  new [ev_pano_group] module

general purpose abs
-------------------
*  new [ev_gemwin] module
*  new video and image recording/grabbing module [ev_record]
*  new [ev_declare] module to load the right pathes on startup

projection abstractions
-----------------------
*  [ev_pro_grid] is now built into all projection modules. 
   (No need to create it specifically anymore)
*  [ev_mouseover] has been dropped. 
   (The mouseover functionality is now integrated into the projection 
   modules)
*  new [ev_pro_55] module with 5x5 vertex-points
*  added new rendered grid to the projection modules
*  NEW: added horizontal and vertical "weight" factor for perspective 
   projection
*  renamed all projection modules
*  NEW: [ev_texhelper] module for easy texture coordinates selection

general abstractions for OpenGL Shaders
---------------------------------------
*  new [ev_glsl] module for easy shader implementations


Release Notes v0.31
===================

changed ev_pro_flat and ev_pro_curved abstractions:
---------------------------------------------------
*  no gemhead included anymore for consistency with easymap abstractions
*  gemhead now has to be connected externally, see corresponding 
   helpfiles for details
*  second creation argument of ev_pro_flat/curved deprecated

changed ev_buf:
---------------
*  no gemhead built in anymore, has to be connected externally for more 
   clear structure of patch and more obvious dataflow, see helpfile 
   for example

changed ev_mouseover:
---------------------
* removed creation arguments; 
  render order and gemwin dimen must from now on be set via messages.

added new example patches:
--------------------------
*  ev_module-list (quick overview of the modules)
*  ev_example_masking (masking capabilities for video mapping)
*  ev_example_3d (3d renderings)
*  ev_example_framebuffers (using multiple framebuffers)
*  ev_example_vfx (pix_É video effects)
*  ev_example_grids (using the two different grids)
*  ev_example_storage&osc (using the data storage solution 
   & transmit/receive osc-streams

*  minor changes inside the data storage logic (v0.1)
*  minor changes in gil, not affecting the toolkit (v0.11)

*  fixed some bugs inside ev_grid
*  added flip functions to ev_pro_grid

*  fixed bug in ev_buf: framebuffer content was translated 0/0/-5. 
   Now 0/0/-4 to compensate the viewpoint mismatch of framebuffer and 
   gemwin. Also all helpfiles & examples using ev_buf have been corrected.


Release Notes v0.3
==================

Due to some major changes, this version is not backwards compatible 
to previous versions.

*  integrated new storage system which supports multiple scenes in one file
*  mrpeach osc externals are not needed anymore.
*  prepared for bidirectional osc-communication without feedback
*  added support for on-screen drag&drop interaction (vertex position, 
   texture position) using GIL
*  completely new help-patches & examples
*  added grid function to the projection modules
*  new folder structure
*  all files have been modified
*  no backwards compatibility to older versions
*  added new projection modules: ev_easymap22, ev_easymap33


Release Notes v0.22
===================

*  fixed: ev_grid: some wrong init parameters.


Release Notes v0.21
===================

*  fixed parameters.pd
*  added lens correction control to the input modules (cam, pic, vid)


Release Notes v0.2
==================

The following bugs are now fixed:

ev_sto
------
*  in some cases, not all parameters were saved.

ev_pro_curved
-------------
*  /ev/pro/$1/vertex/top/center/y could not be stored or loaded
*  the shade settings (soft edging) could not be stored

ev_pro_flat
-----------
*  the shade settings (soft edging) could not be stored

ev_buf
------
*  the framebuffer options format, rectangle, color and type could not be modified, stored or loaded

ev_EXAMPLE
----------
*  preset not loaded at startup
*  pictures were not loaded at startup
*  missing example for control bus system

parameters.pd
-------------
*  confusing nams for ev_storage

ev_storage
----------
*  missing parameters.pd in helpfile
*  confusing: object name: "ev_storage", but OSC syntax: "/ev/preset/..."


The following files have been modified:
---------------------------------------
*  ev_sto.pd
*  ev_buf.pd
*  ev_buf-help.pd
*  ev_pro_curved.pd
*  ev_pro_curved-help.pd
*  ev_pro_flat.pd
*  ev_pro_flat-help.pd
*  ev_EXAMPLE.pd
*  ev_storage.pd
*  ev_storage-help.pd
*  parameters.pd
*  preset0.txt (has been moved inside the project folder)
